- Movie making is one of the biggest industry.
- Comprises of various disciplines like __ideation, screenwriting, pre-production, post-production, direction, animation, acting__ etc.
- Thousands, maybe millions of livelihood depend on movie industry. If movie industry was to suffer a setback, many of these people will be affected.

In 2019, __global box office__ was worth __$42.2 billion__. This is just from ticket sales. If other allied incomes like merchandise sales, satellite revenue, DVD sales etc are taken into account, then this amount will be far greater.

## Problem Statement
Over the course of 10 years, movie industry started to see some changes in box-office revenues. This can be attributed to various reasons. With the data that was given to us, we were asked to provide some insights on how to bring back revenues or even increase it.

## Dataset
We were provided with data of movies released from 2006 to 2016. The data alongwith movie title and year released, also had other info like genre, runtime, revenue metascore etc. All these info helped in analysis.
